# i18n-package
In daily development, internationalization (i18n) is a common challenge, especially when an app needs to support multi-language switching. The text in the app interface must adapt to different languages, which is where the use of language packs becomes essential.

While translation software can help with multi-language translations, it often falls short when it comes to specific terms or context. For instance, in a Chinese app, the term “我的” is often translated as “My,” but what we really need in certain cases is “Profile.” Similarly, “个人中心” is often better translated as “Profile” rather than other alternatives. These translation errors usually require manual corrections.

However, it is difficult for a single developer to be proficient in multiple languages. Therefore, I propose creating and organizing a comprehensive language pack. This would allow us to look up accurate translations directly from the language pack, ensuring more precise localization.
